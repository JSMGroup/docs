# Claiming purchased products

:::info

If you purchased a product before **20th April 2023**, you must **migrate** your license. This means you should join our [Roblox Product Hub](https://www.roblox.com/games/13188104119) and hit 'Migrate My Licenses' in the bottom-left. 

:::


:::warning Heads up!

JSM product downloads will be removed from the Discord server on **7th June 2023**. They will be moving to the [Axon web portal](https://axon.whitehill.club). It is recommended that you download future products from here. 

:::

To retrieve your products, use the slash command `/updateproducts` owned by Axon in our Discord server. Wait patiently for the data from the database to be fetched, you will be given access to the product channel by a role.

If you bought more products, use the same slash command to receive the new products.
