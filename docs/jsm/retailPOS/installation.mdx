## 1) Enable HTTP Requests {#1}

In Roblox Studio with your selected game open, click the 'Home' tab, then 'Game Settings'. Move to the 'Security' tab in the open window and make sure the slider for 'Allow HTTP Requests' is enabled and then hit 'Save'.

## 2) Product Insertion {#2}

Insert your file by 'dragging' the product file into Roblox studio with your game fully loaded. The deactivation field has been purposely left unobfuscated to show you an example of disabling tags, you could place this in one-way systems to reduce the amount of activations by trolling customers.
